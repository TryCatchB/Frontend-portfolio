          To create a Frontend-portfolio website, I used modern technologies
          such as React for building interfaces, Vite for quick project
          assembly, as well as HTML and CSS for styling. The project also
          implements navigation using React Router, data management through
          React Query, as well as the use of axios to work with APIs. In order
          to ensure code quality, I have integrated eslint.
